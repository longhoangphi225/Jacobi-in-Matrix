# Introduction

  - Instead of exact symbolic answers, which require a large amount of computation, as well as the existence of very influential errors in the calculation, numerical analysis gives approximate solutions within the specified error limits , especially for problems of large size.
  - In this report, our group will study about one of the methods used to approximate the solution of the system of first-order linear equations AX = B: single iteration method and Jacobi iterative method.
  - The Jacobi method is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a dominant diagonal matrix of linear equations. Each diagonal element is solved and an approximation is input. The process is then repeated until it converges. The method is named after the German mathematician Jacobi.
